# The Odin Project - Etch a Sketch Solution 

This is a solution to the [Etch-a-Sketch challenge on The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch). The Odin Project is a free open-source coding curriculum that provides a comprehensive study path for aspiring developers.

## My process

### Built with

- Figma (wireframe)
- HTML
- CSS
  - Flex Containers 
  - Custom Properties 
- JavaScript 
  - DOM Manipulation
    - Element creation to add all of the squares in the grid based on a user defined size 
    - Element removal to remove squares and replace them when grid size is updated
    - Event Listeners to update pen color and grid size when input is changed

### What I learned

- Using '!+tab' will autofill the HTML boilerplate ü§Ø
- Can put a min and max range on an input element and that there are a lot of different input types 
- Explored different types of event listeners (mouseover, mouseup/down) üñ±Ô∏è
- DOM elements can be removed and replaced 
- Use the 'input' events for immediate, real-time updates and the 'change' event for actions that happen after the user finishes their input

### Continued development

Once I learn more about grids, I plan to come back and restructure this project. This will make it less demanding to create a higher resolution canvas.
